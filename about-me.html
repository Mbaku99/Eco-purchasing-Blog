			 	<h2>About me</h2>
			 	
			 	<h3>&#127758;Introduction&#127758;</h3>
			 		<p>
			 			Hi there, my name is Wilf (see picture) and I am an avid "environmentalist" even if that is a word. Even though I believe in collective and industry level change in sustainability, I think it is important to apply this to our lifestyles, if not for our planet then for our health. Using organic, natural and waste-less materials are key to maintain a sustainable lifestyle and thats what I hope to be presenting here! <strong><em>Enjoy</em></strong>
			 		</p>
			 	<h3>&#127758;Education&#127758;</h3>
					<p>
					I went to the University of Reading where I studied 'Environmental Management', so while I am not an expert I know some of my stuff getting to know a range of topics such as climate change, biology, conservation, land management, urban greenspace, GIS, pollution (water, air, soil)

			 	<h2>About the Blog</h2>
			 	
			 	<h3>&#127758;What is the blog?&#127758;</h3>
			 		<p>
			 			"Blog" I wish there was a less-buzz-wordy-word for this website but it is what it is. Anyway, this bog is firstly, a way for me to practise my website building skills, and secondly a presentation of all these eco-friendly products which are purchased out of neccessity rather than overconsumption. Luckily I currently have and have had quite the stock of items which I can get at reviewing.
			 		</p>
			 	<h3>&#127758;Why is the blog?&#127758;</h3>
					<p>
						Using eco-friendly products is not the saviour to all the environmental destruction in the world.
					</p>
					<p>
						However, it can be a form of activism; supporting these businesses that incorporate health, natural ingredients and eco-friendliness allows for these organisations which are climate change positive to thrive amongst larger conglomerates. Furthermore, regognising and purchasing these products may allow for industrial systemtic change, in which others adopt more of these well-recognised practises.
					</p>
					<p>
						You may also look into these products to better personal health and well-being. Many eco-friendly products will be likely to incorporate natural ingredients. Each article will delve into whether these are better for each function, however on a whole it can be assumed that using naturally derived ingredients over synthetic or toxic varieties are better for our health!
