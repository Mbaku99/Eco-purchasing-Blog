					<h3>&#127758;Introduction&#127758;</h3>

						<h6>What is <em>toothsoap?</em></h6>
							<p class="article_text1"> Yes, you saw that correctly, took me a few re-reads. This is a cool alternative to tubed toothpaste. Well I guess it still comes in a tube. With this trendy badboy, you can lather your toothbrush up like a traditional soap bar, to brush your teeth (hence the inventive name).</p>

					<h3>&#127758;Practical Guide&#127758;</h3>
						
						<h6>How do you use it?</h6>

						<ol>
							<li class="numbered_list">Run your brush under some cold water (unless you like it warm?)</li><br>
							<li class="numbered_list">Get your toothsoap and rub the wet bristles over the stick till you see a lather</li><br>
							<li class="numbered_list">Brush your teeth like normal</li>
						</ol>

						<h6>Made by who or whom?</h6>
							<p class="article_text1"> Tis made by the fantastic <a href="https://uk.georganics.com/" target="_blank">Georganics</a>, a UK (Brighton) based company which produce a variety of mouth hygene products.</p>
				
						<h6>When & where did ya buy it?</h6>
							<p class="article_text1"> I snagged this guy on the <strong>18th of September 2021</strong> through <a href="https://thegreenturtle.co.uk/" target="_blank">the green turtle website</a>. <br><a>(review here)</a></p>

						<h6>How long does it last?</h6>
							<p class="article_text1">Well... i've had this guy for exactly 109 days, and I must say that I am impressed. I had hoped to be using the toothsoap while travelling to China, however it was cancelled (damn that COVID sucker) but its still coming in handy.</p>
							<p class="article_text1">At first, just like many toothpastes I wa using a heavy amount, (in comparsion to what I use now) to make sure I was getting enough on my teeth while brushing. But I soon realised that only a small amount was enough to lather up and do good! I now just move my toothbrush around the stick about twice till I see it lathered on the brush.</p>

						<h6>Tips & Tricks?</h6>
							<p class="article_text1">I was today years old when I realised you could push the bottom of the tube to raise it up so that when the upper parts get exhausted, you can still use the tube without taking the toothsoap out. This wasn't described on the website so I am fully amazed right now!</p>

				
					<h3>&#127758;Let's get down to the science&#127758;</h3>

					<img class="nutritional" src="img/nutritional_facts.jpg" alt="toothsoap image">

						<h6>Fluoride</h6>
							<p class="article_text1">Fluoride is the first thing that comes to mind when I think of “Toothpaste” and I reckon I'm not the only one. It has been talked about for ages whether we should be putting it in our toothpastes, this is a general summary of the scientific chatter:</p>

							<p class="article_text1">It is naturally occurring all through nature, in our soils, animals, water and more. It has been added to toothpaste since its discovery for reducing tooth decay in naturally high content water. It is now widely accepted that fluoride causes the mineralisation of the teeth; a hardened layer over the tooth to prevent bacteria reaching them and causing decay.</p>

							<p class="article_text1"> There can be serious effects of being exposed to too much fluoride, for instance if accidently swallowed (especially with children). These effects can be acute (short-term) like nausea and vomiting to chronic (long-term) like dental and skeletal fluorosis. Dental fluorosis prevents enamel from fully developing (which also protects the teeth from decay) causing white to brown coloration of the enamel on the teeth and weakening of the bones for skeletal fluorosis.</p>

							<p class="article_text1">So, what does Georganic's toothsoap have to do with this? Simply, it refrains from using fluoride to avoid any bickering: <em>“With all the controversy surrounding fluoride, to us the solution seems clear. Let’s find a safe, natural alternative to prevent tooth decay!”.</em> Instead it uses natural ingredients to ultimately perform the same task of preventing tooth decay.</p>

							<p class="article_text1">Recently in the UK, it was announced that fluoride will be increased in many water supplies to prevent tooth decay hopitalisation. Maybe have a look into this to see if you are affected and consider if the fluoride in water and toothpaste together is too much?</p>

						<h6>Coconut & Olive Oil</h6>

							<p class="article_text1">Oils have been used traditionally, specifically in India to perform an act called “oil pulling”. In this activity, a person gets a tablespoon of oil, puts it in their mouth and swishes it around for about 20 minutes before spitting it out and washing their mouth. Coconut oil is a typical example oil used, and olive oil is too, but less so.</p>

							<p class="article_text1">From oil pulling research and in toothpastes, coconut oil has shown to provide many benefits for oral hygene. This mainly includes reducing plaque sticking to the teeth, building up and its general minimisation. Furthermore, it is known to be antimicrobial, reduce mouth sores and create teeth whitening, while maintaining a pleasant taste!</p>

							<p class="article_text1"> Less research seems to have been conducted on olive oil, being more refined than its coconut counterpart. However, it has been seen to have antimicrobial effects, boosting the immune system whilst whilst also preventing plaque formation.</p>

							<p class="article_text1">However, much of the research has been conducted by using oil pulling techniques, and this toothsoap is only meant to be used for 2 minutes, not 20 like recommended in oil pulling. Could this mean that the common effects listed may not be as effective in such a short time? Would you like to be swishing your toothpaste around for 20 minutes?</p>

							<h6>Sodium Hydroxide</h6>

							<p class="article_text1">This is a chemical utilised in "Saponification". In this process an oil (the coconut and olive oil) reacts with the sodium hydroxide to create the soap.</p>

							<p class="article_text1"> According to Georganics, the sodium hydroxide is noted as an ingredient to meet legal requirements for the manufacturing. However, there is no trace of this chemical which is present in the final consumer product. So despite not being listed as natural, there should be no health risks by being in contact with the product.</p>

							<h6>Cocoa Butter</h6>

							<p class="article_text1">Also known as theobroma oil, this is derived from the Cocoa Bean (choccy). It is known to contain small amounts of Theobromine and Caffine. Initial studies show theobromine to have hardening effects for protective tooth enamel and can be antimicrobial.</p>

							<p class="article_text1"> One study (9) states that cocoa butter itself has the ability to protect teeth by resisting damage from sugars. However, research on this topic seems to be quite rare.</p>

							<h6>Peppermint Oil</h6>

							<p class="article_text1"></p>

							<h6>Limonene</h6>

							<p class="article_text1">This hydrocarbon derivived from citrus oils. It has been shown in several experimental studies that it could have interesting effects on limiting tooth decay and bleaching teeth whiter in combination with other substances</p>
